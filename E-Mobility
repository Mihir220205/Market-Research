Electric vehicles represent the transition of transportation from electric vehicles to vehicles using electricity in general. It includes a variety of electric vehicles (EVs), including electric cars, buses, trucks, bicycles, and scooters, and the systems necessary to support their operation. Electric vehicles aim to reduce the environmental impact of transportation by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, pollution and dependence on non-renewable fossil fuels. Key components of electric vehicles include advanced battery technology, charging and integration of renewable energy. Electric vehicles have advantages such as lower operating costs, less noise and improved energy efficiency. As communities around the world seek efficient transportation solutions, electric vehicles play an important role in creating clean, efficient, connected cities and rural transport, helping to create a safe and healthy future.
